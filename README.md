This is yawei's unix assignment
In this assignment, there are two data files for me to inspect and analysis.
My UNIX assignment consists two components:
The inspection of data
The processing of these same data files to produce output files that are formatted for a subsequent analysis
My workflow for both data inspection and processing are as following:

#total 6209

#-rw-r--r--. 1 yaweil domain users       82 Sep 22 14:51 README.md

 #the number of column of fang_et_al_genotypes.txt 986
#  the number of column of snp_position.txt 15
#UNIX Assignment

##Data Inspection

###Attributes of fang_et_al_genotypes

here is my snippet of code used for data inspection
$wc

By inspecting this file I learned that:

the numbers of lines words bytes filename are 2783  2744038 11051939 respectively.

###Attributes of snp_position.txt

here is my snippet of code used for data inspection
$wc 

By inspecting this file I learned that:

the numbers of lines words bytes filename are 984 13198 82763
